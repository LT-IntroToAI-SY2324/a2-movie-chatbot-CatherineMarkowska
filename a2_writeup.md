# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
What was difficult for me while completing the mach function was making sure that I wrote each if statement correctly. I based each if statment off of each other, so if I got one wrong, the others would be wrong as well. I also didn't really understand accum or when to use it, but now I do. I also didn't understand originally when to use pind and sind, but now I do. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You can use the match function for extracting information from a movie database by checking if what is in the match function matches something in the database. Then, you could write an if statement that tests the match function and returns the information in the desired way.
